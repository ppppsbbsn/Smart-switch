This project uses face detection to control electrical switches through an ESP32. A camera detects a face, and the ESP32 activates or deactivates relays to turn appliances ON or OFF.


How It Works

-- Camera detects face

-- Python script sends command to ESP32

-- ESP32 toggles relay

-- Switch/appliance turns ON/OFF

-- Usage
